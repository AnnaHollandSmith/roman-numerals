:pencil2: Read my blog: [This Girl Codes](https://thisgirlcodes.co.uk/)

I am a former Criminal Defence Lawyer excited to begin my career as a web developer.

As a graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 16-week coding bootcamp focused on Ruby and Javascript, I look forward to joining a company where I can make a real difference as a junior developer.

During my time at Makers Academy I learned how to think more like a programmer, write clean test-driven code, and pick up new languages and technologies. As such, I subscribe to Agile/XP values and would also look for opportunities to continue with TDD (test-driven development) and pair programming in any future role.

#### Commitment
I remain committed to various causes addressing important social issues. I am a member of [WHFNP](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/) (Women Hack for Non-Profits) and will volunteer at MozFest 2016. Having benefitted  directly from organisations such a Code First: Girls, Codebar, and Women Who Code, I am willing to dedicate my time and newly acquired skills to increasing participation and diversity within the field.

#### Fast Learner
The ability to take a pragmatic and considered approach to problem-solving has enabled me to adopt and utilise new skills and concepts quickly and efficiently throughout my career. As a lawyer, I was often required to work flexibly and adapt quickly whilst maintaining high standards.

These skills became even more apparent whilst at Makers Academy. For the Makers Academy final project, I committed to and completed a hybrid-mobile application that was built using Cordova and Node.js. We also built our own Rails Server API for the back-end. This was beyond the scope of the course as we had only had two weeks dedicated to learning vanilla JavaScript prior to the project.
- The group presentation for the project can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/177900577)

#### Teaching and Mentorship
I have particularly enjoyed the mentoring system at Makers Academy as well as the collaborative learning environment that was cultivated through pair programming and regular group projects. I love helping others to understand new concepts and using teaching opportunities to further develop my own knowledge. As a result of my new-found enjoyment of this aspect of programming, I now volunteer as a coach at [codebar](https://codebar.io/)
